	Compile Me!
	
	This example is designed to show how you can use third party frameworks like
	Bootstrap to build advanced user interfaces, while still keeping all the
	code local. This script can be compiled and still function fine without the
	need to extract any files to a temporary directory.
	
	As this example is more advanced, it assumes a stronger familiarity with the
	technology and may gloss over some parts more than other examples. If you're
	just getting started it may be helpful to work with some of the other
	example scripts first.
